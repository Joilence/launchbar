==================

Requires at least LaunchBar Version 6 (currently in beta)

Copy to iPhone
--------------

Action that uses the [Command-C](http://danilo.to/command-c) application to send either the text or files selected in LaunchBar or your system clipboard to your iPhone. Requires that you have [Command-C](http://danilo.to/command-c) installed on your Mac and your iPhone.

Note: if you don't use 'iPhone' as the device name for your phone in [Command-C](http://danilo.to/command-c) then after running this action once go to `~/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Action Support/com.renaghan.launchbar.CopyToIPhone/Preferences.plist` and adjust the setting to match your preferred name
