###NOTE on `.applescript` files

Text `.applescript` Apple scripts are used here for ease of integration with version control systems, diff tools...

The LaunchBar action `Info.plist` refers to a *COMPILED* `.scpt` version of the script.

You can compile these text `.applescript` files into `.scpt` files using command line `/usr/bin/osacompile` or by exporting within Script Editor
